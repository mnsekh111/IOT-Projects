# Arduino specific setup details
We have hard coded the calibration to be the first 10 seconds from when the serial monitor connection is established. You need to show the arduino light sensor an example of a 0 and a 1. you can do this by turning the led on and off. Please do not try to operate this setup in a bright environment as this will make the LED light not as effective as the surounding light.
